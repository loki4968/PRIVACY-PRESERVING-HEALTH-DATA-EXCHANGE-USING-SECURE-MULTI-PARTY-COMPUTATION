# Secure Computation Security Methods

This document provides detailed information about the security methods implemented in the Health Data Exchange platform for secure multiparty computation.

## Overview

The Health Data Exchange platform supports three primary security methods for secure computations:

1. **Standard** - Basic encryption for data in transit and at rest
2. **Homomorphic Encryption** - Allows computations on encrypted data without decryption
3. **Hybrid (Homomorphic + SMPC)** - Combines homomorphic encryption with secure multiparty computation

## Security Methods in Detail

### Standard Security

The standard security method provides basic protection for data:

- **Data Encryption**: All data is encrypted during transit using TLS/SSL
- **Database Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest in the database
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control restricts data access
- **Audit Logging**: All data access and operations are logged

**Use Case**: Suitable for non-sensitive data or when performance is a priority.

### Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic encryption allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first:

- **Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**: Supports arbitrary computations on encrypted data
- **Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)**: Supports specific operations (addition or multiplication)
- **Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE)**: Supports a limited number of operations

In our implementation, we use a somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme that supports:

- Addition of encrypted values
- Multiplication by constants
- Limited number of operations before noise becomes too large

**Technical Implementation**:
- Based on the BFV (Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren) scheme
- Uses polynomial rings for encryption
- Implements noise management techniques

**Use Case**: Ideal for computations where data privacy is critical and operations are primarily additive (e.g., computing averages, sums).

### Hybrid (Homomorphic + SMPC)

The hybrid approach combines homomorphic encryption with Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC):

- **Homomorphic Layer**: Data is first encrypted using homomorphic encryption
- **SMPC Layer**: Computation is distributed across multiple parties using SMPC protocols
- **Threshold Cryptography**: Requires a minimum number of parties to decrypt results

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses Shamir's Secret Sharing for the SMPC component
- Implements threshold decryption
- Provides configurable threshold parameters

**Use Case**: Best for highly sensitive data requiring maximum security guarantees, where computation involves multiple organizations that don't fully trust each other.

## Security Method Comparison

| Feature | Standard | Homomorphic | Hybrid |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Data Privacy** | Basic | High | Very High |
| **Computation Speed** | Fast | Slow | Very Slow |
| **Supported Operations** | All | Limited | Limited |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Low | High | Very High |
| **Resource Requirements** | Low | High | Very High |

## Choosing the Right Security Method

Consider these factors when selecting a security method:

1. **Sensitivity of Data**: More sensitive data requires stronger security methods
2. **Performance Requirements**: More secure methods have higher computational overhead
3. **Types of Computations**: Complex operations may not be supported by all methods
4. **Trust Model**: Consider the level of trust between participating organizations
5. **Regulatory Requirements**: Some regulations may mandate specific security levels

## Implementation Details

### Key Generation and Management

For homomorphic and hybrid methods, key generation follows these steps:

1. Each participant generates a key pair (public/private)
2. Public keys are shared with all participants
3. For hybrid method, key shares are distributed using Shamir's Secret Sharing

### Computation Process

1. **Initialization**: Computation is created with specified security method
2. **Participation**: Organizations join the computation
3. **Data Submission**: Each organization submits encrypted data
4. **Computation**: System performs secure computation based on the security method
5. **Result Verification**: Results are verified for integrity
6. **Result Distribution**: Final results are distributed to authorized participants

### Audit and Verification

All secure computations include:

- Comprehensive audit logging
- Integrity verification of submissions
- Validation of computation results
- Participant verification

## Security Considerations and Limitations

- **Homomorphic Performance**: Homomorphic encryption has significant performance overhead
- **Noise Growth**: Homomorphic operations increase noise, limiting the number of operations
- **Threshold Requirements**: Hybrid method requires minimum number of participants
- **Key Management**: Secure key management is critical for all methods

## Future Enhancements

Planned security enhancements include:

- Implementation of more efficient homomorphic encryption schemes
- Support for more complex operations in homomorphic mode
- Enhanced key management and rotation
- Additional verification mechanisms
- Performance optimizations for all security methods
