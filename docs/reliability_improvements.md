# System Reliability Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to improve the reliability of the Health Data Exchange system, specifically addressing issues with rate limiting (HTTP 429) and token expiration (HTTP 401) in the Secure Computations Dashboard.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Rate Limiting Configuration**
   - Increased rate limits from 60 requests/minute to 180 requests/minute
   - Increased hourly limits from 1000 requests/hour to 3000 requests/hour
   - Excluded secure computation endpoints from rate limiting to prevent HTTP 429 errors

### Frontend Changes

1. **Token Refresh Mechanism**
   - Enhanced `fetchApi` function in `api.js` to automatically refresh expired tokens
   - Implemented retry logic with new token when authentication fails
   - Prevented infinite refresh loops with retry flag

2. **Rate Limiting Handling**
   - Added exponential backoff retry logic to all API calls in the Secure Computation Dashboard
   - Implemented automatic retries (up to 5 attempts) with progressively longer delays
   - Added user-friendly toast notifications to inform users about retries

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added specific error messages for rate limiting and authentication issues
   - Implemented progressive notification system that informs users about retry attempts
   - Enhanced error state management to avoid UI flickering during retries

## Functions Modified

### Backend
- `RateLimitMiddleware` in `middleware.py`

### Frontend
- `fetchApi` in `api.js`
- `fetchComputations` in `SecureComputationDashboard.jsx`
- `fetchActiveParticipants` in `SecureComputationDashboard.jsx`
- `fetchPendingRequests` in `SecureComputationDashboard.jsx`
- `handleAcceptRequest` in `SecureComputationDashboard.jsx`
- `handleDeclineRequest` in `SecureComputationDashboard.jsx`

## Testing

To verify these changes:

1. Monitor network requests in the browser developer tools
2. Check for absence of HTTP 429 errors in the secure computations dashboard
3. Verify that authentication errors (HTTP 401) are automatically handled with token refresh
4. Confirm that user notifications appear appropriately during high traffic situations

## Future Considerations

1. Implement a more sophisticated rate limiting strategy based on user roles
2. Add client-side request batching to reduce the number of API calls
3. Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern for more resilient API communication
4. Add more detailed logging for rate limiting and authentication events
