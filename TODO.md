# Frontend-Backend Integration Update Progress

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. API Configuration Updated
- âœ… Updated `app/config/api.js` with all new enhanced endpoints
- âœ… Added endpoints for enhanced ML, federated learning, privacy ML, secure computations, and monitoring analytics
- âœ… Maintained backward compatibility with legacy endpoints

### 2. ML Service Updated
- âœ… Updated `app/services/MLService.js` to use new enhanced endpoints
- âœ… Added support for enhanced ML analysis, federated learning, and privacy-preserving ML
- âœ… Updated time series, risk assessment, and anomaly detection methods
- âœ… Maintained backward compatibility

### 3. Secure Computation Service Updated
- âœ… Updated `app/services/secureComputationService.js` with enhanced endpoints
- âœ… Added fallback mechanism to legacy endpoints if enhanced fails
- âœ… Updated key methods: createComputation, joinComputation, submitData, getComputationResult

### 4. Analytics Service Updated
- âœ… Updated `app/services/analyticsService.js` with enhanced monitoring analytics endpoints
- âœ… Added comprehensive error handling and fallback to legacy endpoints
- âœ… Updated all mental health, laboratory, and vitals analysis methods

### 5. Frontend Components Updated
- âœ… Updated `app/components/MLDashboard.jsx` to work with new services
- âœ… Updated `app/components/SecureComputation.jsx` to use enhanced endpoints with fallback
- âœ… `app/components/AnalyticsDashboard.jsx` already uses updated analyticsService

### 6. Testing and Validation âœ…
- âœ… **Backend Integration Test**: All enhanced endpoints tested and working
  - âœ… Enhanced ML endpoint: `/enhanced-ml/analyze` - Status 200
  - âœ… Enhanced Federated Learning endpoint: `/federated-learning/initiate` - Status 200
  - âœ… Enhanced Secure Computation endpoint: `/secure-computations/enhanced/create` - Status 200
  - âœ… Enhanced Monitoring Analytics endpoint: `/monitoring-analytics/enhanced/mental-health/phq9` - Status 200
- âœ… **Service Layer Testing**: All updated services tested successfully
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Fallback mechanisms verified
- âœ… **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy endpoints still functional
