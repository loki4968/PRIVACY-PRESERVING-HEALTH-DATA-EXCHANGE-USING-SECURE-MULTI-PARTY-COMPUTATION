# Privacy-Preserving Health Data Exchange Using Secure Multi-Party Computation

## Abstract

Healthcare organizations face significant challenges in sharing sensitive patient data for collaborative research and analytics while maintaining privacy compliance. This paper presents a comprehensive system for privacy-preserving health data exchange using Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE). Our implementation enables multiple healthcare organizations to perform joint computations on encrypted health data without revealing individual patient information. The system supports various statistical operations including sum, average, and complex health analytics while ensuring HIPAA compliance and maintaining data sovereignty. Performance evaluation demonstrates the system's scalability and security effectiveness across different organizational configurations.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The healthcare industry generates vast amounts of sensitive data that could provide valuable insights for medical research, public health initiatives, and treatment optimization. However, privacy regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, and institutional policies create significant barriers to data sharing between organizations.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Traditional approaches to health data sharing involve either:
- Complete data sharing with privacy risks
- Data anonymization with potential re-identification vulnerabilities
- Centralized trusted third parties with single points of failure

### 1.3 Contribution
This paper presents a novel system that enables:
- Secure computation on distributed health data without data movement
- Support for multiple encryption schemes (Standard, Homomorphic, Hybrid SMPC)
- Real-time collaborative analytics with privacy preservation
- HIPAA-compliant architecture with comprehensive audit trails

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Secure Multi-Party Computation in Healthcare
Previous research has explored SMPC applications in genomics [1], epidemiological studies [2], and clinical trials [3]. However, most solutions focus on specific use cases rather than general-purpose health data exchange platforms.

### 2.2 Homomorphic Encryption Applications
Homomorphic encryption has been applied to medical imaging [4], drug discovery [5], and patient monitoring [6]. Our work extends these applications to multi-organizational collaborative analytics.

### 3.2 Cryptographic Protocols

#### 3.2.1 Homomorphic Encryption
We implement Paillier cryptosystem for additive homomorphic operations:

- Encryption: E(m) = g^m × r^n mod n²
- Homomorphic Addition: E(m₁) × E(m₂) = E(m₁ + m₂)

#### 3.2.2 Shamir Secret Sharing
For hybrid SMPC operations:
- Threshold: t participants required for reconstruction
- Share Generation: f(x) = s + a₁x + ... + aₜ₋₁x^(t-1) mod p
