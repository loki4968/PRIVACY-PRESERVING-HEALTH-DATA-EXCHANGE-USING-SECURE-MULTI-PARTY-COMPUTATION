## Project Organization

This document outlines the current project structure and recent reorganization efforts to improve code maintainability and reduce redundancy.

## Recent Reorganization

### Authentication Context

- Consolidated duplicate AuthContext implementations
- Standardized on `app/context/AuthContext.jsx` as the primary implementation
- Created compatible implementation for frontend components in `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js`

### Backend Tests

- Moved test files from root backend directory to `backend/tests/`
- Organized test files by functionality
- Removed redundant test files

### Frontend Consolidation

- Copied components from `frontend/src/components/` to `app/components/`
- Converted .js files to .jsx for Next.js compatibility
- Copied services from `frontend/src/services/` to `app/services/`
- Copied tests from `frontend/src/tests/` to `app/tests/`

## Development Guidelines

### Component Development

- Place all new React components in `app/components/`
- Use `.jsx` extension for all React components
- Follow existing naming conventions

### Authentication

- Use `useAuth()` hook from `app/context/AuthContext.jsx` for authentication
- The hook provides: `{ user, login, logout, loading, isAuthenticated }`

### API Services

- Place API service functions in `app/services/`
- Use the API endpoints defined in `app/config/api.js`

### Testing

- Backend tests should be placed in `backend/tests/`
- Frontend tests should be placed in `app/tests/`

## Future Improvements

1. Complete real-time collaboration features (WebSockets)
2. Finish advanced analytics implementation (federated learning)
3. Prepare production deployment configuration
4. Implement remaining security features
5. Complete documentation
