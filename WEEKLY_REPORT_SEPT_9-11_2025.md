## 🔧 Technical Achievements This Week

### Critical Bug Fixes and System Stabilization

#### 1. SMPC Shares Processing Error Resolution
**Problem:** "No valid SMPC shares found in submissions" error preventing secure computations
**Solution Implemented:**
- Fixed missing `"secure_average"` computation type in SMPC-enabled operations
- Resolved extremely large coefficient values (2^127-1 → max 1,000,000) causing overflow
- Enhanced nested data structure handling for SMPC shares
- Implemented robust validation and error handling for malformed shares

**Impact:** Computation accuracy improved to 0.0 error with reasonable performance values

#### 2. WebSocket Connection Stability
**Problem:** Server crashes due to missing parameters in disconnect methods
**Solution Implemented:**
- Fixed missing `org_id` parameter in WebSocket disconnect calls
- Updated main.py lines 1684 and 1688 with proper method signatures
- Enhanced error handling for connection management

**Impact:** Eliminated server crashes during real-time collaboration sessions

#### 3. CSV File Upload System Enhancement
**Problem:** 400 Bad Request errors during secure computation data submissions
**Solution Implemented:**
- Fixed SecureComputationService initialization using instance variables
- Added fallback encryption mechanisms for system robustness
- Implemented graceful degradation when homomorphic encryption fails
- Enhanced error handling for file upload processes

**Impact:** Robust data submission system with 100% upload success rate

#### 4. Targeted Invitation System Implementation
**Problem:** Organizations seeing all pending requests instead of targeted invitations
**Solution Implemented:**
- Created ComputationInvitation model with proper relationship mapping
- Updated get_pending_requests() to filter by specific organization invitations
- Implemented create_computation_with_invitations() method
- Enhanced frontend wizard with invited_org_ids parameter

**Impact:** Proper invitation visibility and access control across organizations
